# AceCombatZERO

[[한국어 Readme]](https://github.com/lunetis/AceCombatZERO/blob/main/README.kr.md)

Remake Final Mission of Ace Combat Zero with Unity.

* This is a personal project and currently in development.
* Since I'm testing with DualShock 4 (PlayStation 4 Controller), I'm not sure if other gamepads are working properly in this project. (XBOX Controller, etc.)
* Due to asset's license issue, commit histories can be deleted sometimes. (In that case, commit count will be very low.)
* Please check [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/lunetis/AceCombatZERO/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for other used assets.
